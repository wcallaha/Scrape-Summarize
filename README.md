# Scrape and Summarize

<Description of project> 

### Installing `pipenv` 
This project uses [`pipenv`](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#homebrew-installation-of-pipenv) to manage dependencies. Below are the needed steps to install pipenv and run the scraper scripts:
- If on Windows, download [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/).
- Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on MacOS and [Linuxbrew](https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux) for Windows/Linux systems
- Follow the instructions to install [`pipenv`](https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#homebrew-installation-of-pipenv) 
- In your Terminal (on a Mac) or Git Bash (on Windows), run the command `pipenv install` in the root directory of the project. This will install all dependencies listed in the `Pipfile`.
- Finally, run the command `pipenv run python ScrapeSummarizeV1.py`
